<h2>
    A Love of Simplicity
</h2> 

<p> 
    I've been writing code since 1990, when I was just 7 years old.  I started
    out with GW-Basic, then on to QBasic, Visual Basic, C, C++, and then I went
    to college at <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/">WPI</a>, where my horizons for
    languages just exploded.  
</p>
<p> 
    I have an affection for the earliest days of personal computing, although
    I'm too young to remember the S-100 bus and frontpanel computers.  I started
    out in the era of 80386.  Implementing virtual versions of old computers and
    running classic software on VMs, especially if I can get it to run right off
    the old binaries, is especially satisfying to me.
</p>

<h2> 
    Citizen of (the) Federation
</h2>

<p>
    I am a huge Trekkie, and although my knowledge is not as encyclopedic as it
    was when I was younger (hey, there's a lot more Trek now!) I am still a
    formidable force in a trivia game.
</p>
<p> 
    I am also a huge fan of federated services.  I strongly believe that the
    Internet is made stronger when we have strong federated services in the
    backbone of the tools we use everyday.  SMTP, NNTP, and more modern tools
    in the so-called Fediverse that allow users to run services on their own
    metal and for system administrators to tend to their own users with policy
    decisions is The Way.
</p>
<h2>
    Stompy Robots
</h2>
<p>
    Besides Star Trek, my home fandom is BattleTech.  I have been playing since
    1995 in one form or another.  I enjoy the game for its own merits, but I
    also learned many technologies when I was younger in the service of
    playing, running, and analyzing BattleTech games.  I continue to be
    a member of the BattleTech community, with what little time I have.
