<h2>
    A Love of Simplicity
</h2> 

<p> 
    I've been writing code since 1990, when I was just 7 years old.  I started
    out with GW-Basic, then on to QBasic, Visual Basic, C, C++, and then I went
    to college at <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/">WPI</a>, where my horizons for
    languages just exploded.  
</p>
<p> 
    I have an affection for the earliest days of personal computing, although
    I'm too young to remember the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-100_bus">S-100 bus</a> and 
    frontpanel computers.  I started out in the era of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386">80386</a>.  Implementing 
    virtual versions of old computers and running classic software on VMs, 
    especially if I can get it to run right off the old binaries, is 
    especially satisfying to me.
</p>

<h2> 
    Citizen of (the) Federation
</h2>

<p>
    I am a huge Trekkie, and although my knowledge is not as encyclopedic as it
    was when I was younger (hey, there's a lot more Trek now!) I am still a
    formidable force in a trivia game.
</p>
<p> 
    I am also a huge fan of federated services.  I strongly believe that the
    Internet is made stronger when we have strong federated services in the
    backbone of the tools we use everyday.  SMTP, NNTP, and more modern tools
    in the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">
    Fediverse</a> that allow users to run services on their own metal and for
    system administrators to tend to their own users with policy decisions is
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_(Fastball_song)">The Way</a>.
</p>
<h2>
    Stompy Robots
</h2>
<p>
    Besides Star Trek, my home fandom is <a href="https://bg.battletech.com/">
    BattleTech</a>.  I have been playing since 1995 in one form or another.  I
    enjoy the game for its own merits, but I also learned many technologies 
    when I was younger in the service of playing, running, and analyzing 
    BattleTech games.  I continue to be a member of the BattleTech community, 
    with what little time I have.

<h2>Original Github Repositories</h2>

<h3 class="repo_header"><a href="https://github.com/Bronzite/HIndex">HIndex</a></h3>

<p class="repo_desc">
    This is an H-Index calculator for BoardGameGeek's API.  It computes the 
    maximum number n such that a player has played n different board games
    n or more times.
</p>

<h3 class="repo_header"><a href="https://github.com/Bronzite/TwitterMazeRunner">Twitter Maze Runner</a></h3>

<p class="repo_desc">
    This was a Twitter bot that allowed users to reply to steer the bot 
    through a maze.  It no long functions after 2023 updates to the Twitter
    API.
</p>

<h3 class="repo_header"><a href="https://github.com/Bronzite/TuringMachine">Turing Machine</a></h3>

<p class="repo_desc">
    A very simple set of classes that allow for representing a Turing Machine.
    It takes in a set of states and transitions between those states, and can
    run the machine.  There's also a console application in the solution that
    demonstrates running with the 3- and 5-state 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">Busy Beaver</a> 
    machines.
</p>

<h3 class="repo_header"><a href="https://github.com/Bronzite/Kmean">KMean</a></h3>

<p class="repo_desc">
    KMean is a class for computing the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">K-Means</a> of a
    given set of double nodes in cartesian space.  It is very poorly documented
    and was more built to prove to myself I understood the algorithm.  I may
    rewrite it in the future.
</p>

<h3 class="repo_header"><a href="https://github.com/Bronzite/Claymore">Claymore</a></h3>

<p class="repo_desc">
    Claymore is a web app I used to run a BattleTech campaign in 2017 and 2018.
    It is clunky, but effective, and it taught me a great deal about complex
    ASP.NET maintenance and upkeep.
</p>

<h3 class="repo_header"><a href="https://github.com/Bronzite/NetworkingSimulation">
    NetworkingSimulation</a></h3>

<p class="repo_desc">
    This is a project that provides a simple simulation of Ethernet devices.
    At Deep Core Data, we used this is a training tool for new employees.
</p>

<h3 class="repo_header"><a href="https://github.com/Bronzite/CompareLists">
    CompareLists</a></h3>

<p class="repo_desc">
    A short program that takes in a list of strings as a set of files and 
    outputs a file with which file each string appears in.
</p>

<h3 class="repo_header"><a href="https://github.com/Bronzite/DNSTap">DNSTap</a></h3>

<p class="repo_desc">
    A program that listens for DNS requests and forwards them to another DNS
    Server.  It outputs each DNS packet passed to provide visibility into
    requests being made by local applications.
</p>

<h3 class="repo_header"><a href="https://github.com/Bronzite/BattleTechCanonWarShips">
BattleTech Canon WarShips</a></h3>

<p class="repo_desc">
    This is an evolution of a web app created in the early 2010's that listed
    all known WarShips in the BattleTech canon, and the references to them.  
    This database is now long since out-of-date.
</p>

<h3 class="repo_header"><a href="https://github.com/Bronzite/FileDuplicationUtility">
FileDuplicationUtility</a></h3>

<p class="repo_desc">
    This is a tool that scans a directory and computes the hash values of all
    files in the directory to determine which are duplicates of others.  The
    data is then output as JSON.
</p>

<h3 class="repo_header"><a href="https://github.com/Bronzite/BattleTech.NET">
BattleTech.NET</a></h3>

<p class="repo_desc">
    This is a library that has general data processing tools for BattleTech
    objects.  My intention with this library was to make it easier to write
    other tools that analyze BattleTech information, such as unit compositions
    or calculated values such as BV2.
</p>

<h3 class="repo_header"><a href="https://github.com/Bronzite/Altair8800Emulator">
Altair8800Emulator</a></h3>

<p class="repo_desc">
    A library that provides a simple emulation of an Altair 8800 system.  As 
    built it doesn't handle devices like monitors, keyboards, or disks, but it
    is intended to be extendable to use simulated devices practically.
